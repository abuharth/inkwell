# Inkwell
A **text editor** coded in one file of **C code**.
---
This project is based on a [great tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) that takes you through the step by step process
of its creation.
---
There are very little dependencies so this should build out of
the box on a linux machine. Just clone the repository, and run the following commands

```
    > make
    > ./inkwell
```
