(x) Complete the tutorial

---- Possible Addons ----

( ) Make syntax highlighting have control over the text color and highlight color

( ) Add line numbers (make them dim)

( ) Add column number to status bar

( ) Make the title screen show INKWELL in ascii font
    when it is displayed

( ) Integrate ASCII typer into the editor
    - pressing (Ctrl-A) will prompt user (enter text to insert to ascii-art: )

( ) Integrate something like the table formatter to work live within the
    text editor (will show in the render nut not change file contents)
    - looks for this sort of pattern in the file:
    
    |<text>|<text>|<text>|
    ---
    |<text>|<text>|<text>|
    |<text>|<text>|<text>|
    
    - formats the rows so that the bars line up to make a full table
    - can put dividers wherever they want by inputting '---' between/above/below rows
        - algorith can check if there is a row with at least 3 dashes, if true
          then complete the row of dashes until it reaches the end of the row
    - different rows can have different number of columns

( ) Add auto indentation
    - handle bulleted lines
    - auto nest/un-nest when pressing TAB or ENTER on new bulleted line
